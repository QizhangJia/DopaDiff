# DopaDiff
Project DopaDiff

In collaboration with Cheng Yang, University of Virginia.

Molecular dynamics simulation of the diffusion of Dopamine(DA) on the surface of carbon-based microelectrodes, within temporal and spatial depenedent environmental conditions.

1. Use R script to analysis z-distance of DA and graphene.
2. calculate cutoff distance for adsorbed/free states of DA.
3. Select longest/2nd-longest sequence of DA on the surface.
4. Calculate the 2D diffusive coeffecient.
